# API Documentation Development Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the structure and development approach for creating comprehensive API documentation inspired by Laravel's documentation style. The documentation will be organized into clear, well-structured chapters with a focus on developer experience across all skill levels.

## Documentation Structure

### 1. Root Level Organization
- `README.md` - Main index and introduction
- Numbered chapter files for easy navigation and maintenance
- Assets directory for images and diagrams
- Code examples directory

### 2. Proposed Chapter Structure
1. Getting Started
   - Introduction
   - Quick Start Guide
   - Installation & Setup
   - Authentication

2. Core Concepts
   - Basic Principles
   - Architecture Overview
   - Key Components

3. API Reference
   - Endpoints Overview
   - Request/Response Formats
   - Error Handling
   - Rate Limiting

4. Guides & Tutorials
   - Common Use Cases
   - Best Practices
   - Integration Examples

5. Advanced Topics
   - Security Considerations
   - Performance Optimization
   - Webhooks
   - Events

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Initial Setup
1. [ ] Create directory structure
2. [ ] Set up version control
3. [ ] Initialize documentation framework
4. [ ] Create README template

### Phase 2: Content Development
1. [ ] Parse and analyze specification file
2. [ ] Create detailed chapter outlines
3. [ ] Write core documentation sections
4. [ ] Develop code examples
5. [ ] Create diagrams and visual aids

### Phase 3: Enhancement & Polish
1. [ ] Add search functionality
2. [ ] Implement syntax highlighting
3. [ ] Create interactive examples
4. [ ] Add cross-references and navigation

### Phase 4: Review & Testing
1. [ ] Technical review
2. [ ] Documentation testing
3. [ ] Developer feedback integration
4. [ ] Final polishing

## Next Steps
Please provide the specification file (`document.yaml`) contents to:
1. Analyze API structure and requirements
2. Refine chapter organization
3. Create detailed content plan for each section
4. Identify specific examples and use cases to highlight

## Style Guidelines
- Clear and concise writing
- Consistent formatting
- Comprehensive code examples
- Progressive disclosure of information
- Cross-referencing between related topics
- Clear navigation structure

## Notes
- This is a living document that will be updated as we analyze the specification file
- Chapter structure may be adjusted based on API complexity and requirements
- Documentation will follow Laravel's proven documentation patterns while maintaining its own identity
