1. [x] Create directory structure
2. [x] Set up version control
3. [x] Create README.md with project overview
4. [x] Establish style guide and templates
5. [x] Set up navigation structure

### Phase 2: Core Documentation
1. [x] Write Getting Started guide
2. [x] Document authentication system
3. [x] Create core concepts documentation

2. [x] Add real-world scenarios (License Management, Installation Tracking)
3. [x] Include common use cases
4. [ ] Add integration examples

### Phase 5: Review and Polish
1. [ ] Technical review
2. [ ] Copy editing
3. [ ] Test all examples
4. [ ] Verify all endpoints
5. [ ] Final formatting and structure check

## Style Guidelines

### Writing Style

## Next Steps
1. Begin with directory structure setup
2. Create initial README.md
3. Start with Getting Started guide
4. Implement authentication documentation
5. Progress through core concepts

## Notes
- Documentation will be version controlled
- Each chapter will be self-contained
- Cross-referencing between related topics
- Regular updates based on API changes
- Focus on developer experience
