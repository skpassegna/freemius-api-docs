# Errors

This section describes how the Freemius API handles errors and provides guidance on interpreting error responses.

## Error Responses

When the Freemius API encounters an error, it returns a JSON response with a structured format to help you understand the issue.  The standard error responses are defined in the OpenAPI specification and follow a consistent structure.

### Example Error Response

```json
{
  "path": ":/products/123/users.json",
  "error": {
    "type": "UnauthorizedAccess",
    "message": "Invalid API Key.",
    "code": "invalid_api_key",
    "http": 401,
    "timestamp": "Thu, 11 May 2024 11:45:30 +0000"
  },
  "request": {
    "some_parameter": "some_value"
  }
}
```

### Error Response Structure

* **`path`** (string): The API endpoint path that generated the error.
* **`error`** (object): Contains detailed information about the error.
    * **`type`** (string): A descriptive type for the error (e.g., "UnauthorizedAccess", "InvalidParameter").
    * **`message`** (string): A human-readable error message.
    * **`code`** (string): A machine-readable error code.
    * **`http`** (integer): The HTTP status code associated with the error (e.g., 400, 401, 404).
    * **`timestamp`** (string): The timestamp of the error.
* **`request`** (object):  Reflects the request parameters received by the server, aiding in debugging.

## Common HTTP Status Codes and Their Meanings

* **400 Bad Request:**  Indicates a problem with the request itself, such as malformed syntax or invalid parameters.
* **401 Unauthorized:**  Indicates that authentication is required and has failed or is not provided. This usually means your API key is missing or invalid.
* **402 Payment Required:** Indicates a problem with payment or billing.
* **404 Not Found:**  Indicates that the requested resource was not found. This could mean an incorrect product ID, user ID, etc.

## Handling Errors

When integrating with the Freemius API, you should implement error handling to gracefully manage these responses. Here's an example of basic error handling with cURL in a bash script:

```bash
response=$(curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_Key}" https://api.freemius.com/v1/products/{product_id}.json)
http_code=$?

if [[ $http_code -ne 0 ]]; then
  echo "Error: cURL returned code $http_code"
  echo "$response" # Examine the JSON error response
else
  # Process the successful response
  echo "$response"
fi
```

In applications using HTTP client libraries like Guzzle (PHP) or Requests (Python), these libraries provide built-in mechanisms for handling different HTTP status codes and parsing JSON responses, making it easier to implement robust error handling.
