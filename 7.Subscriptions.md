# Subscriptions

This section explains how to manage subscriptions associated with your Freemius products.  You can retrieve subscription details, list subscriptions for a product or user, and update a subscription's auto-renewal status.

## Retrieving a Subscription

To retrieve a specific subscription, use the following `GET` request:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_Key}" https://api.freemius.com/v1/products/{product_id}/subscriptions/{subscription_id}.json
```

Replace `{product_id}` and `{subscription_id}` with their respective IDs (integers).

### Specifying Fields

Use the `fields` query parameter (string, comma-separated) to specify which fields to include in the response:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_Key}" "https://api.freemius.com/v1/products/{product_id}/subscriptions/{subscription_id}.json?fields=id,created,billing_cycle"
```

## Listing Subscriptions

### For a Product

To retrieve a collection of subscriptions for a specific product, use the following `GET` request:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_Key}" https://api.freemius.com/v1/products/{product_id}/subscriptions.json
```

#### Filtering and Pagination

You can filter and paginate the results using the following query parameters:

* **`search`**: Search by subscription ID, external subscription ID, or user email (string).
* **`billing_cycle`**: Filter by billing cycle (integer, enum: 1, 12, 0).
* **`gateway`**: Filter by payment gateway (string, enum: "paypal", "stripe").
* **`filter`**: Filter by subscription status (string, enum: "all", "active", "cancelled", default: "all").
* **`extended`**: Include enriched data like plan name, install URL, and user email (boolean, default: `false`).
* **`count`**: Number of subscriptions to retrieve (integer, maximum 50, default 25).
* **`offset`**: Number of subscriptions to skip (integer, default 0).
* **`sort`**: Sort order (string, enum: "id", "next_payment", default: "-id" - descending by ID).

Example:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_Key}" "https://api.freemius.com/v1/products/{product_id}/subscriptions.json?filter=active&count=10&extended=true"
```

### For a User

To retrieve subscriptions for a specific user, use:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_Key}" https://api.freemius.com/v1/products/{product_id}/users/{user_id}/subscriptions.json
```

This endpoint supports the same filtering and pagination parameters as listing subscriptions for a product, as well as `plan_id` (string) and `store_id` (integer) filters.


## Listing Subscriptions for a License

To retrieve subscriptions associated with a specific license, use the following `GET` request:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_Key}" https://api.freemius.com/v1/products/{product_id}/installs/{install_id}/licenses/{license_id}/subscriptions.json
```

This endpoint supports the `count`, `offset`, and `fields` query parameters.

## Updating a Subscription

To update a subscription's auto-renewal status or apply a cancellation coupon, use the following `PUT` request:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_Key}" \
     -X PUT \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d "{\"auto_renew\":true, \"coupon_id\": 123}" \
     https://api.freemius.com/v1/products/{product_id}/subscriptions/{subscription_id}.json
```

* **`auto_renew`** (boolean):  Set to `true` to confirm auto-renewal.
* **`coupon_id`** (integer):  Optional cancellation coupon ID.

You cannot directly cancel a subscription through the API.  Cancellation must be handled through the [Freemius Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.freemius.com).
