# Authentication

The Freemius API uses Bearer authentication for most endpoints. You will need an API key to make authenticated requests.  For developer-specific actions, the API also supports cookie and header-based authentication.

## Bearer Authentication (API Key)

Most Freemius API endpoints require an API Key for authentication. This key should be passed in the `Authorization` header of your HTTP requests.

### Retrieving Your API Key

1. Log in to the [Freemius Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.freemius.com).
2. Navigate to the settings page of the product or store for which you need the API Key.
3. Select the **API Key** tab.
4. Copy the API Key.

### Making Authenticated Requests

Here's an example using cURL to make an authenticated request:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_Key}" https://api.freemius.com/v1/products/{product_id}.json
```

Replace `{API_Key}` with your actual API key and `{product_id}` with the ID of the product you're retrieving.

## Developer Authentication (Internal Use)

For developer-related endpoints (marked as "internal" in the API specification), Freemius utilizes cookie-based and header-based authentication using the `FSA` (Freemius Secure Access) token.

### FSA Token Format

The FSA token has the following format: `FSA {scope_entity_id}:{access_token}`.

* `{scope_entity_id}`: The ID of the developer entity.
* `{access_token}`: The access token generated upon login.

### Retrieving the FSA Token

The FSA token is generated and stored as an HTTP-only cookie named `fsa_access_token` after a successful login via the `/developers/{developer_id}/login.json` endpoint.  This endpoint is primarily for internal use by the Freemius Developer Dashboard.

### Using the FSA Token (Cookie)

The `fsa_access_token` cookie will automatically authenticate subsequent requests to internal developer endpoints.  You don't need to explicitly include it in your requests.  However, if you need to manage the cookie directly (e.g., in a non-browser environment), you can include it in the `Cookie` header:

```bash
curl -H "Cookie: fsa_access_token=FSA {scope_entity_id}:{access_token}" http://api.freemius-local.com:8080/v1/developers/{developer_id}/bank_account/{bank_account_id}.json
```

### Using the FSA Token (Header)

Alternatively, the FSA token can be passed in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: FSA {scope_entity_id}:{access_token}" http://api.freemius-local.com:8080/v1/developers/{developer_id}/bank_account/{bank_account_id}.json
```

## Regenerating API Keys

To regenerate an API Key, you need to regenerate the secret key of the associated product or store from the "Information" tab in the Settings page of the Freemius Developer Dashboard.  This will also invalidate the previous API Key.
