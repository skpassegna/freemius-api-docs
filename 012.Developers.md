# Developers (Internal Use)

This section describes endpoints related to developer management, primarily intended for internal use by the Freemius platform.

## Logging In

The login endpoint allows a developer to authenticate and obtain an FSA (Freemius Secure Access) token, stored as an HTTP-only cookie. This token is then used for subsequent requests to other developer-related endpoints.

```bash
curl -X POST \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d "{\"email\":\"jane@freemius.com\",\"password\":\"password123\",\"recaptcha_token\":\"{recaptcha_token}\",\"remember_me\":true}" \
     http://api.freemius-local.com:8080/v1/developers/{developer_id}/login.json
```

Replace `{developer_id}` with the developer's ID (integer) and `{recaptcha_token}` with the reCAPTCHA token if required.  This request is made to the local development API server.  See the [Introduction](1.Introduction.md) for server URL details.

### Request Body Parameters

* **`email`** (string, required): The developer's email address.
* **`password`** (string, required): The developer's password.
* **`recaptcha_token`** (string):  reCAPTCHA token, if required by the login process. Obtain this through the Developer Dashboard.
* **`remember_me`** (boolean):  If `true`, sets the cookie expiration to 7 days; otherwise, the cookie expires in 12 hours.
* **`code`** (string): 2FA 6-digit code if TOTP-based 2FA is enabled for the developer.
* **`backup_code`** (string): 2FA backup code (24 characters) to disable and bypass 2FA.

**Important Notes:**

* This endpoint is designed for use within the Freemius Developer Dashboard and is not intended for general public use.
* The reCAPTCHA functionality is tied to the Developer Dashboard.


## Retrieving Bank Account Information

To retrieve bank account information for a developer, use the following `GET` request:

```bash
curl -H "Cookie: fsa_access_token=FSA {scope_entity_id}:{access_token}" http://api.freemius-local.com:8080/v1/developers/{developer_id}/bank_account/{bank_account_id}.json

# OR (using header-based authentication)

curl -H "Authorization: FSA {scope_entity_id}:{access_token}" http://api.freemius-local.com:8080/v1/developers/{developer_id}/bank_account/{bank_account_id}.json
```

Replace `{developer_id}` and `{bank_account_id}` with the respective IDs (integers). The FSA token obtained after login is required for authentication, either through the `fsa_access_token` cookie or the `Authorization` header.  This request is made to the local development API server.
