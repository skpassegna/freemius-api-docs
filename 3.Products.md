# Products

This section details how to manage your Freemius products through the API.  You can retrieve product details and update certain product properties.

## Retrieving a Product

To retrieve a specific product's information, use the following `GET` request:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_Key}" https://api.freemius.com/v1/products/{product_id}.json
```

Replace `{product_id}` with the ID of the product you want to retrieve.  The `{product_id}` is an integer.

### Specifying Fields

You can limit the fields returned in the response using the `fields` query parameter.  Provide a comma-separated list of the fields you need.  This helps reduce the response size and improves performance.

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_Key}" "https://api.freemius.com/v1/products/{product_id}.json?fields=id,title,slug"
```

This will only return the `id` (integer), `title` (string), and `slug` (string) fields for the product.

## Updating a Product

To update a product, use the following `PUT` request:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_Key}" \
     -X PUT \
     -F "data={\"title\":\"New Product Title\",\"slug\":\"new-product-slug\"}" \
     https://api.freemius.com/v1/products/{product_id}.json
```

This example updates the product's `title` and `slug`.  The `data` parameter contains a JSON encoded string with the fields you want to update.  Remember to properly escape the JSON string for your shell environment.  Both `title` and `slug` are strings.

### Updating Product Icon

You can update the product's icon using a multipart form-data request:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_Key}" \
     -X PUT \
     -F "icon=@/path/to/icon.png" \
     -F "data={\"title\":\"New Product Title\"}" \
     https://api.freemius.com/v1/products/{product_id}.json
```

This example updates the product icon and the title simultaneously. The `icon` parameter takes the path to the image file.  The allowed file types are JPG, PNG, and GIF. The maximum file size is 200KB, and dimensions should not exceed 300x300 pixels.  The `title` is a string.

### Updatable Fields

The API specification indicates the following fields can be updated via the `/products/{product_id}.json` endpoint:

* `slug` (string)
* `title` (string)
* `type` (string, enum: "plugin", "theme", "widget", "template")
* `plans` (string, comma-separated plan IDs)
* `features` (string, comma-separated feature IDs)
* `money_back_period` (integer)
* `refund_policy` (string, enum: "flexible", "moderate", "strict")
* `annual_renewals_discount` (integer)
* `renewals_discount_type` (string, enum: "percentage", "dollar")
* `is_pricing_visible` (boolean)
* `default_plan_id` (integer)
* `accepted_payments` (integer, enum: 0 (both), 1 (PayPal), 2 (Credit Cards))
* `expose_license_key` (boolean, SaaS products only)

Refer to the [Data Structures](14.DataStructures.md) section for more detailed information about each field and their allowed values.  There are no search or filtering parameters available for updating products.


## Pinging a Product (Internal Use)

The `/products/{product_id}/ping.json` endpoint is marked as internal and primarily used for checking the product status, GDPR compliance requirements, and version updates. It uses a `GET` request and accepts query parameters like `uid` (string, required), `is_update` (boolean), and `is_gdpr_test` (boolean). See the [Introduction](1.Introduction.md) for server URL details.  This endpoint does not use Bearer authentication.
