# Payments

This section explains how to manage payments associated with your Freemius products.  You can retrieve payment details and list payments for a product, user, or install.

## Retrieving a Payment

To retrieve details for a specific payment, use the following `GET` request:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_Key}" https://api.freemius.com/v1/products/{product_id}/payments/{payment_id}.json
```

Replace `{product_id}` and `{payment_id}` with their respective IDs (integers).

### Specifying Fields

Use the `fields` query parameter (string, comma-separated) to specify the fields to include in the response:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_Key}" "https://api.freemius.com/v1/products/{product_id}/payments/{payment_id}.json?fields=id,created,gross"
```

## Listing Payments

### For a Product

To retrieve a collection of payments for a specific product, use the following `GET` request:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_Key}" https://api.freemius.com/v1/products/{product_id}/payments.json
```

#### Filtering, Pagination, and Search

You can filter, paginate, and search the results using various query parameters:

* **`search`**: Search by `payment_id` (integer), `external_payment_id` (string), or `user_email` (string).
* **`search_user_id`**: Filter payments by user ID (integer).
* **`billing_cycle`**: Filter payments by billing cycle (integer, enum: 1, 12, 0).
* **`currency`**: Filter payments by currency (string, enum: "usd", "eur", "gbp").
* **`coupon_id`**: Filter payments by coupon ID (integer).
* **`filter`**: Filter payments by type (string, enum: "all", "refunds", "not_refunded", "disputed", "won_disputes", "chargebacks", default: "all").
* **`extended`**: Include linked user, plan, and subscription information (boolean, default: `false`).
* **`from`**: Start date for the date range filter (string, YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format).
* **`to`**: End date for the date range filter (string, YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format).
* **`count`**: Number of payments to retrieve (integer, maximum 50, default 25).
* **`offset`**: Number of payments to skip (integer, default 0).

Example:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_Key}" "https://api.freemius.com/v1/products/{product_id}/payments.json?filter=refunds&from=2024-01-01%2000:00:00&to=2024-01-31%2024:59:59"
```

### For a User

To retrieve payments for a specific user, use the following `GET` request:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_Key}" https://api.freemius.com/v1/products/{product_id}/users/{user_id}/payments.json
```

This endpoint supports the `fields`, `offset`, `count`, `extended`, `include_addons`, `include_bundles`, `filter` ("all", "refunds", "not_refunded", "not_refunded_renewals"), and `billing_cycle` query parameters.

### For an Install

To retrieve payments associated with a specific install, use the following `GET` request:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_Key}" https://api.freemius.com/v1/products/{product_id}/installs/{install_id}/payments.json
```

This endpoint supports the `extended`, `count`, `offset`, and `fields` query parameters.
