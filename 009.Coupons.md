# Coupons

This section explains how to manage coupons associated with your Freemius products. You can retrieve coupon details, list coupons, and create new coupons.

## Retrieving Coupons

To retrieve a collection of coupons for a specific product, use the following `GET` request:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_Key}" https://api.freemius.com/v1/products/{product_id}/coupons.json
```

Replace `{product_id}` with the ID (integer) of your product.

### Filtering and Searching

You can filter and search coupons using the following query parameters:

* **`code`**: Filters coupons by a specific coupon code (string).  Example: `code=SUMMER2024`
* **`search`**: Searches coupons by coupon code or ID (string or integer). Example: `search=BLACK` or `search=123`
* **`prefix`**: Filters coupons by coupon code prefix (string). Example: `prefix=SPRING`


### Pagination and Enrichment

* **`count`**: Number of coupons to retrieve (integer, maximum 50, default 25).
* **`offset`**: Number of coupons to skip (integer, default 0).
* **`is_enriched`**: If `true`, includes multi-currency discount properties.  This only works if *no other filtering is used*. (boolean)

Example with enrichment:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_Key}" "https://api.freemius.com/v1/products/{product_id}/coupons.json?is_enriched=true"
```

Example with filtering:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_Key}" "https://api.freemius.com/v1/products/{product_id}/coupons.json?code=SUMMER2024"
```

**Important Note:** If you use any filtering parameters (`code`, `search`, or `prefix`), the `is_enriched` parameter will be ignored.

## Creating a Coupon

To create a new coupon, use the following `POST` request:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_Key}" \
     -X POST \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d "{\"code\":\"NEWYEAR2025\",\"discount\":15,\"discount_type\":\"percentage\",\"plans\":\"123,456\",\"start_date\":\"2024-12-26%2000:00:00\",\"end_date\":\"2025-01-05%2024:59:59\",\"redemptions_limit\":100,\"has_renewals_discount\":true,\"is_one_per_user\":false,\"is_active\":true}" \
     https://api.freemius.com/v1/products/{product_id}/coupons.json
```

Replace `{product_id}` with the ID (integer) of your product. Refer to the [Data Structures](14.DataStructures.md) section for a detailed explanation of each field and its data type.

### Required Fields for Coupon Creation

While the API allows sending any of the coupon properties, to successfully create a coupon, you must provide values for the following fields:

* `code` (string)
* `discount` (integer)
* `discount_type` (string, enum: "dollar", "percentage")


### Recommended Practices for Coupon Creation

When creating coupons programmatically, it's highly recommended to set appropriate values for the following fields to prevent misuse:

* `plans` (string, comma-separated plan IDs): Specify which plans the coupon applies to.
* `redemptions_limit` (integer): Limit the number of times the coupon can be used.
* `end_date` (string, date-time format): Set an expiration date for the coupon.
* `is_one_per_user` (boolean): Restrict coupon usage to one redemption per user.
