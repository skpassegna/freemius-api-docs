# Freemius API Documentation

This repository contains comprehensive, beginner-friendly documentation for the Freemius API.  It's designed to help developers, even those with basic API experience, understand and effectively utilize the Freemius API for integrating with their applications or services.

**Note:** This documentation is generated based on the Freemius OpenAPI 3.0.0 specification available at [https://freemius.com/help/documentation/api/](https://freemius.com/help/documentation/api/).  While every effort has been made for accuracy, **community review and contributions are highly encouraged** to ensure completeness and identify any potential oversights.

## Features

* **Clear and Concise Explanations:**  Each section provides step-by-step instructions and easy-to-understand explanations, making the API accessible to developers of all levels.
* **Practical Examples:**  Includes numerous cURL examples demonstrating how to make API requests and handle responses.  These examples can be easily adapted to other HTTP client libraries.
* **Comprehensive Coverage:** Covers all endpoints and data structures defined in the OpenAPI specification, including authentication, product management, user management, licenses, subscriptions, payments, coupons, carts, trials, and developer-related actions (internal use).
* **Well-Structured Organization:**  Organized into numbered Markdown files for easy navigation, with a global table of contents for quick access to specific sections.
* **Data Structure Reference:** Includes a dedicated section providing a detailed reference for all API data structures, including common properties, enums, and individual object schemas.
* **Error Handling Guidance:**  Provides clear explanations of error responses, common HTTP status codes, and best practices for handling errors in your integrations.
