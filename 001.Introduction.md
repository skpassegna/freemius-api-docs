# Introduction

The Freemius API provides a programmatic interface to interact with your Freemius data. You can use it to manage products, licenses, users, subscriptions, payments, and more. This documentation will guide you through using the API with clear examples and explanations.

## What is Freemius?

Freemius is a platform that simplifies the selling and management of software licenses, particularly for WordPress plugins and themes. It handles licensing, checkout, updates, and other essential tasks, allowing developers to focus on building their products.

## Why Use the Freemius API?

The Freemius API allows you to integrate Freemius with your own applications and services.  Here are some potential use cases:

* **Custom Integrations:**  Integrate Freemius with your SaaS or other platforms to automate licensing and user management.
* **Data Analysis:**  Retrieve data about your sales, users, and licenses for analysis and reporting.
* **Automated Tasks:** Automate tasks like license generation, user creation, and subscription management.

## API Endpoints

The Freemius API is organized around RESTful principles.  You interact with the API by sending HTTP requests to specific endpoints. Each endpoint performs a different function, such as retrieving data or creating a new resource.  The API returns data in JSON format.

## API Servers

The Freemius API has two server environments:

* **Production:** `https://api.freemius.com/v1` - Use this for live applications.
* **Local Development:** `http://api.freemius-local.com:8080/v1` -  Use this for testing during development.  *(Marked as internal)*

## Getting Started

This documentation provides examples using cURL, a command-line tool for making HTTP requests. You can also use HTTP client libraries like Guzzle (PHP), Requests (Python), or similar libraries in other languages.
