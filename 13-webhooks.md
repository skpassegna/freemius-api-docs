# Webhooks and Events

## Overview

Based on the API specification's EventLog schema, the Freemius API includes an event system for tracking various activities and changes within the system.

## Event Properties

According to the API specification's EventLog schema:

### Basic Information
- `id` - Unique identifier for the event
- Event type and details
- Associated timestamp and metadata

## Event Types

The API tracks various types of events related to:
- Product activities
- License changes
- Installation updates
- User actions
- Payment processes
- Subscription changes

## Event Logging

### Event Records
Events are logged with:
- Unique identifiers
- Timestamps
- Associated entity information
- Event-specific data

## Best Practices

### Event Handling
1. Implement proper error handling for event processing
2. Validate event data before processing
3. Handle events asynchronously when appropriate
4. Maintain event processing logs

### Security Considerations
1. Verify event authenticity
2. Secure event endpoint access
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Monitor event processing

## Error Handling

Event-related operations may return the following error responses:
- `400` - Bad Request
- `401` - Unauthorized
- `402` - Payment Required
- `404` - Not Found

## Examples

### Event Processing Example

```bash
# Example of retrieving event information
curl -X GET "https://api.freemius.com/v1/products/{product_id}/events/{event_id}" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```
