To activate a license and optionally create a new install, use the following `POST` request to the public endpoint (no `Authorization` header required):

```bash
curl -X POST \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d "{\"uid\":\"{uid}\",\"license_key\":\"{license_key}\",\"url\":\"https://example.com\",\"title\":\"Example Site\",\"version\":\"1.0.0\",\"is_marketing_allowed\":true}" \
     https://api.freemius.com/v1/products/{product_id}/licenses/activate.json
```
