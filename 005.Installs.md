# Installs

This section describes how to manage product installations through the Freemius API.  You can retrieve installation details, create clones of installations, manage licenses associated with installations, list related plans, payments, and retrieve market item data.

## Retrieving Installs

To retrieve a collection of installs for a specific product, use the following `GET` request:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_Key}" https://api.freemius.com/v1/products/{product_id}/installs.json
```

Replace `{product_id}` with the ID (integer) of your product.

### Filtering Installs

You can filter the retrieved installs using several query parameters:

* **`ids`**: Comma-separated list of install IDs (integers) to retrieve specific installs.  Example: `ids=123,456,789`
* **`filter`**: Filters installs by status (string, enum: "all", "active", "inactive", "trial", "paying", "uninstalled", "active_premium", "active_free"). Example: `filter=active`
* **`version`**: Filters installs by product version (string). Example: `version=1.2.3`
* **`license_id`**: Filters installs by license ID (integer). Example: `license_id=42`
* **`plan_id`**: Filters installs by plan ID (integer). Example: `plan_id=99`
* **`title`**: Filters installs by install title (string). Example: `title=My%20Website` (URL encoded)
* **`url`**: Filters installs by install URL (string). Example: `url=https://example.com`
* **`search`**: Searches installs by domain, site ID, or reason info (string). Example: `search=example.com`
* **`all`**: If `true`, includes uninstalled installs (boolean, default: `false`). Example: `all=true`
* **`reason_id`**: Filters installs by reason ID (string or numeric). Example: `reason_id=12` or `reason_id=some_reason`

### Pagination and Fields

Use `count` (integer, maximum 50, default 25) and `offset` (integer, default 0) for pagination, and `fields` (string, comma-separated) to specify the fields to return:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_Key}" "https://api.freemius.com/v1/products/{product_id}/installs.json?filter=active&count=10&fields=id,title,url"
```


## Managing Install Clones

Freemius supports managing install clones, which are typically created during site migrations or for staging purposes.

### Creating a Clone

To create a clone of an existing install, use the following `POST` request:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_Key}" \
     -X POST \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d "{\"site_url\":\"https://staging.example.com\"}" \
     https://api.freemius.com/v1/products/{product_id}/installs/{install_id}/clones.json
```

Replace `{product_id}` and `{install_id}` with the respective IDs (integers).  The `site_url` (string) parameter is required and specifies the URL of the cloned site.

### Resolving a Clone

After creating a clone, you need to resolve it by specifying its resolution status:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_Key}" \
     -X PUT \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d "{\"resolution\":\"new_home\",\"new_install_id\":12345}" \
     https://api.freemius.com/v1/products/{product_id}/installs/{install_id}/clones/{clone_id}.json
```

Replace `{clone_id}` with the ID of the clone (integer) and provide the `resolution` (string, enum: "temporary_duplicate", "new_home", "long_term_duplicate") and optionally the `new_install_id` (integer) if a new install was created.


## Install-Specific Resources

* **Licenses:**  See the [Licenses](6.Licenses.md) section for details on activating, deactivating, and retrieving licenses associated with an install.
* **Plans:** `/products/{product_id}/installs/{install_id}/plans.json` (GET) - Retrieves plans available for the install. Accepts `show_pending` (boolean) and `fields` (string, comma-separated) query parameters.  A specific plan can be retrieved using  `/products/{product_id}/installs/{install_id}/plans/{plan_id}.json` (GET), accepting the `fields` query parameter.
* **Payments:** `/products/{product_id}/installs/{install_id}/payments.json` (GET) - Retrieves payments associated with the install. Accepts `extended` (boolean), `count` (integer), `offset` (integer), and `fields` (string, comma-separated) query parameters.
* **Market Items:** `/products/{product_id}/installs/{install_id}/market_items.json` (GET) - Retrieves market items associated with the install.
* **Trials:** See the [Trials](11.Trials.md) section for details on managing trials associated with installs.  Specifically `/products/{product_id}/installs/{install_id}/plans/{plan_id}/trials.json` (POST) for starting a trial.
* **Sending User Verification Email (Internal Use):** `/products/{product_id}/installs/{install_id}/users/{user_id}/verify.json` (PUT) - Sends a verification email to the user associated with the install.  This endpoint is marked for internal use.  Accepts a JSON request body with an optional `after_email_confirm_url` (string) parameter.  Creating New Licenses: `/products/{product_id}/installs/{install_id}/plans/{plan_id}/pricing/{pricing_id}/licenses.json` (POST) - Creates a new license for the specified install, plan, and pricing.  Requires either `period` or `expires_at` in the request body. Also accepts `is_block_features` and `send_email` in the request body.
