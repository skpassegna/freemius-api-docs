# Trials

This section describes how to manage trial licenses associated with your Freemius products. You can retrieve trial details and list trials for a product.  You can also start a trial for a specific plan and install.

## Retrieving Trials

To retrieve a collection of trials for a specific product, use the following `GET` request:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_Key}" https://api.freemius.com/v1/products/{product_id}/trials.json
```

Replace `{product_id}` with the ID (integer) of your product.

### Filtering, Pagination, and Date Range

* **`fields`**: Comma-separated list of fields to include in the response (string).
* **`offset`**: Number of trials to skip (integer, default 0).
* **`count`**: Number of trials to retrieve (integer, maximum 50, default 25).
* **`from`**: Start date for the date range filter (string, YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format).
* **`to`**: End date for the date range filter (string, YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format).

Example:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_Key}" "https://api.freemius.com/v1/products/{product_id}/trials.json?from=2024-01-01%2000:00:00&to=2024-01-31%2024:59:59&count=50"
```

## Starting a Trial

To start a trial for a specific plan and install, use the following `POST` request:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_Key}" \
     -X POST \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d "{\"trial_ends\":\"2024-07-15%2010:00:00\"}" \
     https://api.freemius.com/v1/products/{product_id}/installs/{install_id}/plans/{plan_id}/trials.json
```

Replace `{product_id}`, `{install_id}`, and `{plan_id}` with their respective IDs (integers).
