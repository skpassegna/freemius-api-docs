# Carts

This section explains how to manage carts associated with your Freemius products. You can retrieve cart details, list carts, update cart information, and delete carts.

## Retrieving a Cart

To retrieve details for a specific cart, use the following `GET` request:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_Key}" https://api.freemius.com/v1/products/{product_id}/carts/{cart_id}.json
```

Replace `{product_id}` and `{cart_id}` with their respective IDs (integers).

### Specifying Fields and Enriched Data

* **`fields`**:  Comma-separated list of fields to include in the response (string).
* **`enriched`**:  If `true`, includes additional details like `gross`, `coupon_code`, and `licenses` (boolean, default: `false`).

Example with enriched data:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_Key}" "https://api.freemius.com/v1/products/{product_id}/carts/{cart_id}.json?enriched=true"
```

## Listing Carts

To retrieve a collection of carts for a specific product, use the following `GET` request:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_Key}" https://api.freemius.com/v1/products/{product_id}/carts.json
```

### Filtering, Pagination, and Email Search

* **`filter`**: Filter carts by status (string, enum: "all", "abandoned", "completed", "recovered", "recovery", "active", default: "all").
* **`offset`**: Number of carts to skip (integer, default 0).
* **`enriched`**: Include enriched data (boolean, default: `false`).
* **`email`**: Filter carts by email address (string).
* **`count`**: Number of carts to retrieve (integer, default 50).

Example:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_Key}" "https://api.freemius.com/v1/products/{product_id}/carts.json?filter=abandoned&count=20&enriched=true"
```

## Updating a Cart (Internal Use)

To update a cart's details, use the following `PUT` request. This endpoint is marked for internal use.

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_Key}" \
     -X PUT \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d "{\"plan_id\":123,\"pricing_id\":456,\"billing_cycle\":12}" \
     https://api.freemius.com/v1/products/{product_id}/carts/{cart_id}.json
```

All fields in the request body are optional. You can update any combination of fields.  Refer to the [Data Structures](14.DataStructures.md) section for the list of updatable fields and their data types.

**Important Considerations:**

* Updating a completed checkout cart is prohibited.
* Updating the coupon requires both the `coupon_id` and `coupon_code`.

## Deleting a Cart (Internal Use)

To delete a cart, use the following `DELETE` request.  This endpoint is marked for internal use.

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_Key}" \
     -X DELETE \
     https://api.freemius.com/v1/products/{product_id}/carts/{cart_id}.json
```
